## Welcome to Daniel Yorba's Soccer Website

I made this website to talk about my favorite sport. Soccer is a very simple game but it can be complex when you start thinking about all the intricate details of the game. It is regarded by many people as the most popular around the world because it is played all over the globe. Soccer is very important to me because I have always been involved in it. Whether I watched games on television, watched my siblings play, or actually played myself, I have always been fascinated by soccer. I hope this website gives you some insight and knowledge that may help you better understand soccer and some important people who have played it.

### The Rules of Soccer

Soccer has many rules and regulations but they can be simplified into a few major rules. Soccer is played by two teams that consist of eleven players on the field and up to seven substitutes on the sidelines. Each team fields one goalkeepers and ten outfield players which consist of the defence, midfield, and forwards. The only player who can touch the ball with their hands is the goalkeeper. Every other player must only use their feet, chest, thighs, or head to touch the ball. If a player touches the ball with their hand, a foul is called and the other team gains possession. If the handball was intentional, the player may receive a yellow card or even a red card depending on the situation and the potential to score a goal. If a player commits many fouls or a very threatening foul, they may receive a yellow card or even a red card if the foul is severe and shows the intention to hurt the other player. One yellow card is a warning to the player. One red card means that the player can't play the rest of the game and the next game after. Red cards may lead to further suspensions. Two yellow cards in one game turns into a red card. The professional games are played for a total of ninety minutes (two 45 minute halves)plus added time for time "wasted" (time that is lost when there are injuries or stoppages). There is a rule called the offside rule. This rule says that if the ball is passed to a player that is behind the defense of the other team, that player is offside. The other team would then gain possession. The objective of soccer is to score more goals than the opposing team. A goal is scored when a player kicks or heads the ball completely over the goal line. If the ball goes out of bounds on the sides of the field, the team who didn't touch the ball last gains possession. This team gets to throw the ball into the field. If the ball goes out on the ends of the field, the team who didn't touch the ball last gains possesion. This team gets a corner-kick. All in all, these are the essential basic rules to know about soccer.
